\title{Generalized Method of Wavelet Moments (GMWM) Package}
\description{
Generalized Method of Wavelet Moments (GMWM) is an estimation technique for the parameters of time series models. It uses the wavelet variance in a moment matching approach that makes it particularly suitable for the estimation of certain state-space models. Furthermore, there exists a robust implementation of GMWM, which allows the robust estimation of some state-space models and ARIMA models. Lastly, the package provides the ability to quickly generate time series data, perform different wavelet decompositions, and visualizations.

\section{Financial Support}{


Primary support for this project was made possible by the Department of Statistics at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). Furthermore, the contributions of undergraduate researcher Wenchao Yang for improving the visualization systems was supported, in part, by a grant from the Office of Undergraduate Research at UIUC. The project was mentored by Prof. Stephane Guerrier.
